OpenVictoria
============

Open Source Victoria 2 Mod, anyone can contribute nearly anything they like. However there are a few rules!

1. No gamebreaking content. Any contributed Content will be run through quality control to make sure it works without ruining the game.

2. No bias for nations to extreme levels. Serbia doesn't need 100 million soldier POPs.

3. Nearly anything else goes. In extreme cases I do reserve the right to filter out content that people have a problem with. Otherwise go wild!
